# Mapping Earthquakes

## Summary
There was a need to visualize earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. One view now shows all of the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the world map. There is now also a view of the data overlayed on a dark third base layer map, which allows for the earthquake data to be shown in greater contrast to the map background.
