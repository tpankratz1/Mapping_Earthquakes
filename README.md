# Mapping Earthquakes

## Summary
There was a need to visualize earthquake data on a world map in several new ways. The following was implemented, using Javascript, HTML, CSS and Mapbox: 
- Earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth
- All of the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5
- A view of the earthquake data overlayed on a dark third base layer map, which allows for the earthquake data to be shown in greater contrast to the map background
